Say there are 100 feedhandlers/connections into tp process
+ 1 feedmaper connection (FM)
FM is getting data from another 100 feedhanler connection

so tp has 101 upstream connections
flow on FM connection is around 100x bigger than on each of the other 100 connections

tp will be running select on 101 connection and consuming limited buffer size from ech incoming queue
It is likely the FM updates will be delayed, tp will become slow consumer, FM memory usage will go up
