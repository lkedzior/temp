//Chapter 1

The scripting language and the database are both running q programs,
a q function defined in a script can be sent to the database where it is evaluated and then only the results are returned.
This is a reversal of the paradigm where data is brought to the analytics.
With q, analytics can be sent to the data.

When the results of a vactor operation are used as the inputs of the next operation,
all the data stored in the CPU's memory cache can be accessed immediately without needing
to search in the slower/larger caches or even the slowest and largest memory sotre located on the motherboard.

1.2. What is Q
I will reserve the term operator for any function that is provided by the q language (implemented in C or in q)

1.3 Programming Paradigms
* Q is interpreted because it requires no compilation phase.
ALL FUNCTIONS are compiled into bytecode at run time.
Definitions are compiled at startup and are lazily resolved.
They must be syntactically correct at startup, but the ordering of compilation is not important.

* Q is dynamic in both function definition and variable types (both can be changed at runtime).
This flexibility adds a runtime penalty as both the function def and variable type must be checked for each function call 
* array/vector programming language

* functional (but not pure functional)

* Kdb+ processes can be written as event handlers. Without concurrency, all q functions run in a single main thread.
To enable interaction with other processes q implements the reactor design pattern.
It demultiplexes the concurrent messages and synchronously inokes callbacks.
Responding to multiple asynchronous events allows kdb+ processes to be used as a Complex Event Processor

In kdb banner, the number of licensed cores appear within the parentheses (
It is possible to reduce the number of cores visible to the q binary on Linux by changing the CPU affinity with the taskset utility.

q needs k4.lic, by default it looks in the same dir as q.k
QLIC env variable can be usde to customise this

Q then loads q.q from QHOME
QINIT can be used to customise the init file

q web server can return files such as crossdomain.xml or favicon.ico
They can be placed in a QHOME/html (different location can be set with .h.HOME)
