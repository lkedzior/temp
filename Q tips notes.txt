//Chapter 1

The scripting language and the database are both running q programs, a q function defined in a script can be sent to the database where it is evaluated and then only the results are returned.
This is a reversal of the paradigm where data is brought to the analytics.
With q, analytics can be sent to the data.

When the results of a vactor operation are used as the inputs of the next operation,
all the data stored in the CPU's memory cache can be accessed immediately without needing
to search in the slower/larger caches or even the slowest and largest memory sotre located on the motherboard.
