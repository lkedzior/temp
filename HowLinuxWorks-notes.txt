fork() - Program(P) creates a copy process
exec(program) - Program(P) starts a new program to replace iteself (replace P)

e.g. type ls in shell and press enter
  -> shell calls fork() to create copy of the shell
  -> new shell calls exec(ls)
  
A shell is a program that runs commands. It also serves as a small programming env.

All different Unix skells derive several of their features from the Bourne shell (/bin/sh),
a standard shell developed for early versions of Unix.
Every Unix system needs the Bourne shell in order to function correctly.

Linux uses an enhanced version of the Bourne shell called bash or the "Bourne-again" shell

The bash shell is the dafault shell on most Linux distributions,
and /bin/sh is normall a link to bash on a Linux system.

2.5.6 find and locate
locate file
locte searches an index that the system builds periodically.

2.8 Environment and Shell Variables
The shell can store TEMPORARY variables, called shell variables, containing the values of text strings.

To assign a value to a shell variable
STUFF=blah

An environment variable is like a shell variable, but it's not specific to the shell.
export STUFF
ALL PROCESSES ON UNIX SYSTEMS HAVE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE STORAGE.


The difference is that the environment variables are passed to programs that the shell runs,
whereas shell variables cannot be accessed in the commands that you run.
