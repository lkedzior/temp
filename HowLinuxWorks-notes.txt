fork() - Program(P) creates a copy process
exec(program) - Program(P) starts a new program to replace iteself (replace P)

e.g. type ls in shell and press enter
  -> shell calls fork() to create copy of the shell
  -> new shell calls exec(ls)
  
A shell is a program that runs commands. It also serves as a small programming env.

All different Unix skells derive several of their features from the Bourne shell (/bin/sh),
a standard shell developed for early versions of Unix.
Every Unix system needs the Bourne shell in order to function correctly.

Linux uses an enhanced version of the Bourne shell called bash or the "Bourne-again" shell

The bash shell is the dafault shell on most Linux distributions,
and /bin/sh is normall a link to bash on a Linux system.
