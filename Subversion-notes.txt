Branching and merging

Create the following folders in your repo

trunk
branches
trunk

under trunk place your projects
trunk/projectA
trunk/projectB
trunk/projectC

Branching
Right click on trunk->Branch/Tag
From .../trunk
To path /branches/testBranch

Then do SVN update to get the new branch from remote to local env

Make changes inside new branch 
Commit branch changes

SWITCH BACK TO TRUNK BEFORE MERGING

Right clink on trunk
1) Merge
2) Merge type -> choose Merge a range of revisions (default)
3)Next
-URL to merge from ..../branches/testBranch
- select all revisions
- make sure working copy is .../trunk
4)Next and Merge

Now local trunk should have the branch changes and the last step is commit trunk changes to remote server
