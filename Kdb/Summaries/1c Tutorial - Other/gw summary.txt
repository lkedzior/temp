  //dispatch to rdb & hdb using full async (record id and client .z.w somewhere in the table)
  //important don't block here
  //end of .z.pg
  
  //block existing client until -30!(.z.w;0b;res) is called, other clients won't be blocked cause .z.pg ends here
  -30!(::); //releasing the handler for other clients
 };
