# Don't store duplicates in history
#ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups
#ignorespace flag tells bash to ignore commands that start with spaces
#ignoredups, tells bash to ignore duplicates
#erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups

# Make bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk
# This will preserve the history across independent sessions

#number of lines or commands that (a) are allowed in the history file at startup time of a session, and (b) are stored in the history file at the end of your bash session for use in future sessions
export HISTFILESIZE=10000

#number of lines or commands that are stored in memory in a history list while your bash session is ongoing
