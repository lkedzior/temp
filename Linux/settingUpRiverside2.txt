Was experiencing delayed ssh login on riverside2 and on 25 or 26th Jan 2020 I up
dated /etc/ssh/sshd_config
as per suggestion here
https://serverfault.com/questions/815538/long-delay-when-logging-in-with-centos7

this helped with with delayed login but ssh started timeing out and v20 prices session started dying 
https://serverfault.com/questions/815538/long-delay-when-logging-in-with-centos7

as of 2020/03/09 the changes have been reverted to same values as on riverside1

[root@riverside1 ~]# grep GSSAPIAuthentication  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
[root@riverside1 ~]# grep UseDNS /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#UseDNS yes

2020/05/08
Timeout issues did not go away
Noticed that there were no timeouts issues when I had run 'ping -t riverside2.'
I have changed the putty Connection settings
'Seconds between keepalives' changed it to 60 and this seems to address the issue

####### 2020/06/13 add scheduled shutdown user root crontab

[root@riverside2 ~]# crontab -l
