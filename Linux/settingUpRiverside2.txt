2020/03/09
Was experiencing delayed ssh login on riverside2 and on 25 or 26th Jan 2020 I up
dated /etc/ssh/sshd_config
as per suggestion here
https://serverfault.com/questions/815538/long-delay-when-logging-in-with-centos7

this helped with with delayed login but ssh started timeing out and v20 prices session started dying 
https://serverfault.com/questions/815538/long-delay-when-logging-in-with-centos7

as of 2020/03/09 the changes have been reverted to same values as on riverside1

[root@riverside1 ~]# grep GSSAPIAuthentication  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
[root@riverside1 ~]# grep UseDNS /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#UseDNS yes

2020/05/08
Timeout issues did not go away
Noticed that there were no timeouts issues when I had run 'ping -t riverside2.'
I have changed the putty Connection settings
'Seconds between keepalives' changed it to 60 and this seems to address the issue

####### 2020/06/13 add scheduled shutdown user root crontab

[root@riverside2 ~]# crontab -l
SHELL=/bin/bash

#Min     0 to 59
#Hour    0 to 23
#Day     1 to 31
#Month   1 to 12
#Weekday 0 to 6, 0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Min   Hour    Day     Month   Weekday Command

####### 2020/06/13 sync time with ntp
https://www.techbrown.com/sync-time-timezone-centos-7/
Install the ntpd package
$ sudo yum install ntp

Start the ntpd services
$ sudo systemctl start ntpd

Edit the configuration file
$ sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf

[LK] I have added the below ntp uk servers from https://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/uk
[LK] this was advised here https://www.tecmint.com/install-ntp-server-in-centos/

[root@riverside2 ~]# cat /etc/ntp.conf | grep server
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
#server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
#server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 0.uk.pool.ntp.org
server 1.uk.pool.ntp.org
server 2.uk.pool.ntp.org
server 3.uk.pool.ntp.org
#broadcast 192.168.1.255 autokey        # broadcast server
#broadcast 224.0.1.1 autokey            # multicast server
#manycastserver 239.255.254.254         # manycast server

After adding these lines simply save and exit.
Restart the services to make changes in effect.
$ sudo systemctl restart ntpd

Enable this services to run at every boot.
$ sudo systemctl enable ntpd

[root@riverside2 ~]# systemctl enable ntpd
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service.

[LK]verify if ntp is working
[root@riverside2 ~]# ntpstat

  time server re-starting
   polling server every 8 s
[root@riverside2 ~]# ntpstat
