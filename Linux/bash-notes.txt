When connecting from putty to a server
Or ssh user@host to a server we start INTERACTIVE session (.bash_profile is loaded)

When we do 'ssh user@host command' we run the command in NON-INTERACTIVE mode
NON-INTERACTIVE mode loads .bashrc only, .bash_profile is not loaded

What we normally want is to give interactive users same shell as we have for bashrc (bash remote controlled)
so we do load .bashrc from .bash_profile


to test this
ssh user:host # interactive mode .bash_profile
ssh user:host : # : here is used as empty command and should enambe rc(remote command / non interactive mode .bashrc)
