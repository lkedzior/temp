2) Second job to deploy to UAT (stop deployInstall start)
This job needs a cmd line parameter $VERSION

albo Parameterized Build
first job always sets the variable e.g. LATEST=$BUILD_NUMBER
second job uses the variable LATEST

3) Run tests specific for UAT

Separate manual job 
* "deploy latest version to PROD (stop deployInstall start) could run e.g. every Saturday
//extreme case would be to run this job after step 3) but this can be possible only if the processes can be restarted during a week without a data loss
