Jenkinks pipe to push to UAT
1) First job create a release (new version; mvn deploy; mvn scm:tag)
2) Second job to deploy to UAT (stop deployInstall start)
3) Run tests specific for UAT

visualise the flow with pipeline build plugin

Separate manual job 
* "deploy latest version to PROD (stop deployInstall start) could run e.g. every Saturday
//extreme case would be to run this job after step 3) but this can be possible only if the processes can be restarted during a week without a data loss

For more complex relations between jobs see  Pipeline Plugin (aka workflow plugin)

This one allowes fully programmable pipelines
